								<b>Education:</b><br>
								Ph.D. in Astrophysics, University of Bonn, Germany (2022)<br>

								<b>Research Interests:</b><br>
								My research focuses on observational cosmology, particularly weak gravitational lensing and cosmic shear surveys. I specialize in developing advanced statistical methods and semi-analytic models to analyze large-scale structure and dark energy. My current work involves combining measurements from different cosmological probes, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), cosmic microwave background observations, and weak lensing surveys to constrain the evolution of dark energy over cosmic time.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Current Role:</b><br>
								As a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at UC Santa Cruz, I am actively involved in the DESI collaboration, working on some of the most precise measurements of our universe's expansion history. I co-lead efforts to combine DESI data with weak gravitational lensing measurements, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of dark energy and the fundamental nature of our cosmos.

								<b>Dark Energy Evolution with DESI</b><br>
								I co-lead the effort to combine DESI spectroscopic data with weak gravitational lensing measurements to probe the evolution of dark energy over the past 11 billion years. Our recent analysis hints that dark energy's influence may be changing over time, challenging the standard cosmological constant model. This work represents some of the most precise constraints on dark energy to date and could point toward new physics beyond our current understanding.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Cosmic Shear Survey Systematics</b><br>
								During my Ph.D., I developed semi-analytic models to understand systematic effects in cosmic shear surveys, particularly the impact of varying observing conditions on weak lensing measurements. This work provided crucial insights for current and next-generation surveys like KiDS, Euclid, and LSST, ensuring that systematic errors don't compromise our ability to measure cosmological parameters precisely.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Statistical Methods in Cosmology</b><br>
								I specialize in developing and applying advanced statistical techniques to cosmological data analysis. My work includes topological data analysis methods, Bayesian inference techniques, and novel approaches to combining different cosmological probes. These methods are essential for extracting maximum information from increasingly complex and large astronomical datasets.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Multi-Probe Cosmology</b><br>
								One of the key challenges in modern cosmology is combining measurements from different observational probes while properly accounting for systematic effects and correlations. I work on developing frameworks to combine data from galaxy surveys, weak lensing, supernovae, and cosmic microwave background observations to provide robust constraints on cosmological models.

							<p>
								I am passionate about sharing the wonders of astronomy and cosmology with the public. Science communication and outreach are essential for connecting our research with society and inspiring the next generation of scientists. Throughout my career, I have been actively involved in several outreach initiatives.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Stars over Streetlights</b><br>
								I am an active member of Stars over Streetlights at UC Santa Cruz, an organization dedicated to raising awareness about light pollution and its effects on astronomy and the environment. Our mission focuses on elementary school students and minority communities, hosting astronomy talks that introduce concepts of light pollution and its connection to astronomical observations. The group received recognition through a Research!America microgrant for our project "Lighting Up Minds, Dimming the Skies," where we give talks at elementary schools in Santa Cruz County to educate students about light pollution and its impacts.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Astronomy on Tap</b><br>
								I participate in Astronomy on Tap events, a global network where professional astronomers give informal science talks in local bars and breweries. These events feature accessible presentations on space and science topics, from planets to black holes to cosmology, accompanied by trivia, games, and direct interaction with the public. The format makes astronomy approachable and fun, creating opportunities for meaningful conversations about science in casual settings.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Astroclub Bonn</b><br>
								During my time in Germany, I was involved with outreach activities through the Astroclub Bonn, contributing to public astronomy events and educational programs that brought university-level astronomy research to local communities. This experience helped me develop skills in communicating complex scientific concepts to diverse audiences.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Public Engagement Philosophy:</b><br>
								I believe that astronomy serves as a "gateway science" that can spark curiosity about all STEM fields. My outreach approach focuses on showing how even in light-polluted urban areas, there are still amazing astronomical phenomena to observe and appreciate. Through these efforts, I aim to demonstrate that science is accessible to everyone and that researchers care deeply about their communities.
